This was a group project that I worked on in collaboration with Milly Young at the University of Exeter.

We developed a machine learning algorithm to classify fetal health states, using a cardiotocography dataset available on the UCI Machine Learning Website. We compared the performance of an XGBoost and a Decision Tree classifier while also handling 
the class imbalance in the dataset through over- and undersampling. Furthermore, we examined how the inclusion of a feature selection step in the pipeline improves the classifiers' performance. The specifics of our methods and results are detailed in 
the accompanying report.

The "Trained Classifiers" folder includes all eight classifiers we examined, if you would like to replicate our results.

I also created a poster detailing the results of my contribution to the project, which I have also included.
